### TL;DR

To get a quick example of a Clojure app setup with full deployment configuration, 
check out the [clojure-kamal-example](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/clojure-kamal-example) 
project. To try it yourself, simply clone the repo and locally execute 
the commands from the [Deploy: summary](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/clojure-kamal-example/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#deploy-summary)
section. For a detailed explanation of each step, including Clojure/Script app setup, 
CI/CD, and deployment, please keep reading. If you already have a Docker-container 
with an exposed `80` port, you can jump right to the "Deployment" 
section of this article.
