## Streamlined Unique Identifier Generation

I am excited to announce the launch of [GetUUID](https://getuuid.top/), a free, open-source web tool designed to make unique identifier generation effortless for anyone who needs quick access to standardized IDs.

## Why I Built GetUUID

During my work with databases and distributed systems, I often needed a quick way to generate unique IDs. This led me to create a simple tool that would make ID generation straightforward and accessible.

I found that existing tools were often bloated with unnecessary features, had poor user experiences, or were limited to only one type of ID format. GetUUID solves these problems with a clean, minimalist approach that puts the focus on what matters: generating IDs quickly and efficiently.

## Multiple ID Formats

GetUUID supports multiple identifier formats to accommodate different use cases:

- **UUID v4**: The industry standard random UUID with strong uniqueness guarantees, perfect for most general purposes
- **UUID v1**: Time-based UUIDs that include MAC address information, ideal for scenarios requiring chronological ordering
- **UUID v7**: The newest UUID standard offering time-ordered identifiers with improved sortability, excellent for database performance
- **ULID**: Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifiers combine the benefits of timestamp ordering with the uniqueness of random IDs
- **Nano ID**: Compact, URL-friendly unique string IDs, perfect for shorter identifiers in web applications

## Key Features

GetUUID was designed with developer productivity in mind:

- **One-Click Copy**: Generate and copy IDs to your clipboard with a single click
- **Local History**: Automatically tracks your last 50 generated IDs, all stored securely in your browser's local storage
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual confirmation when IDs are copied
- **Lightweight and fast**: Minimal dependencies, works offline once loaded, no server-side processing
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices

## Open Source

GetUUID is fully open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/abogoyavlensky/getuuid).
